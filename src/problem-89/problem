The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number (see About Roman Numerals...). However, there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.

For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI

The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.

Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.

Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.
